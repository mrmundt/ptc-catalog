# THG Coding Standards

## Target

Steadily convert the codebase over to an agreed-upon stand.

## User Story

As a person responsible for software quality and correctness for the HDF5 library, I want guidance on selecting and implementing coding standards so that we can make our code easy for everyone to read and understand.

As an HDF5 library developer or community contributor, I want support so that I am complying with the standards with minimal additional effort or ambiguity. 


## Card

| Score | Description |
|:-----:|:------------|
| 0 | No coding standard adopted. See *Tasks to Reach Score 1*, below. |
| 1 | The team has selected and documented an agreed-upon standard.  |
| 2 | New code that is written is required to comply with the standard, and the team has conducted a feedback session to assess and revise the standard. |
| 3 | The team has developed and put into place a refactoring plan to bring preexisting code into compliance with the standard. |
| 4 | Tool support has been put in place to help ensure compliance, and running the tool is made part of the contribution process. |
