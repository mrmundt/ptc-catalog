# End-user Documentation

## Target

Create end-user documentation for a software project

## User Story

As an application developer, I want to document our project, so that new users will try the application.

## Card

| Score         | Description |
| :-------------: | :------------- |
| 0 | Little or no project documentation exists. |
| 1 | An initial set of documentation has been created<sup>1,2</sup>. |
| 2 | Feedback from users is collected on a regular basis and is used to improve documentation<sup>3</sup>.  |
| 3 | Scripts and/or auto-documentation tools are used to ensure the documentation is kept up to date. |
| 4 | Documentation maintenance is incorporated into the project's continuous integration process. |

## Comments

1. A good method for staring is to investigate what documentation is provided by other contemporary similar projects. 
Inspired by research results, create a scope of your eventual ideal end-user documentation.
2. Focus on creation of initial set of documentation that is most likely to be used by end-users (ex: README, software 
introduction guide, software installation and initial setup testing guide, troubleshooting guide etc.
3. Develop a process to solicit feedback on the user documentation and incorporate improvements.
4. Some documentation tools which be useful:
   - [Doxygen](http://doxygen.nl)
   - [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/)
   - [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org)
   - [WriteTheDocs](https://www.writethedocs.org)
