Improve a project's visibility to the community

## User Story

As a project lead, I want to increase my project visibility, so that my project has an increased chance of success.

| 0 | Project has little or no visibility in the community. |
| 1 | Team has identified and defined what "ideal" project visibility would look like<sup>1</sup>. |
| 2 | Team has developed and implemented an initial set of communication mechanisms<sup>2</sup>.  |
| 3 | A communication plan has been developed and rolled out<sup>3</sup>. |
| 4 | An active social media presence has been established<sup>4</sup>. |
| 5 | Communication plan is reviewed by team on a regular basis and improvements and/or updates implemented and documented<sup>5</sup>. |

## Comments

1. One approach to this would be to work within the project team to research contemporary projects and create an "ideal plan" for 
project visibility. Team should define what constitutes "ideal."
2. Identify and create an initial set of communication mechanisms, such as a website, wiki, blogs and contact mailing lists 
within a specified time frame.
3. Develop and implement an actionable plan to publicize the project to the community (e.g. for a research community, through posters and research publications) within a specified time frame. The plan should be achievable by team.
4. The team has defined how "active" a social media presence will be required (e.g. 1 tweet per day, 1 blog post per week, etc.)
5. The communication plan may be revised as the requirements for "ideal" visibility shift.
