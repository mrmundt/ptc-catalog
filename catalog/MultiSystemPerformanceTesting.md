# Multi-System Performance Testing

## Target

Regular, automated testing at on all target platforms.

## User Story

As a software engineer I want to incorporate regular performance testing into my development cycle so that I am able to maintain or improve performance on modern architectures. 

## Card(s)

| Score | Description |
|:------:|:-----------:|
| 0 | Current performance testing practice, e.g., no regular performance testing |
| 1| Irregular, manual, performance evaluation to identify bottlenecks on a single system |
| 2| Regular (e.g., monthly) manual performance testing on a single system |
| 3| Regular (e.g., monthly) manual performance testing on several target HPC systems |
| 4| Partially automated performance testing on several target HPC systems |
| 5| Completely automated, regular (e.g., nightly) performance testing on all target HPC systems; designated team member monitors results and creates issues as software components are changed, added, or removed or new hardware platforms are targeted. |
