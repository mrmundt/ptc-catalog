# Build a Local Community of Practice

## Target

Build a local community around your software project.

## User Story

As an individual software contributor I want to build a community so that I can network and share projects and ideas.

## Card(s)

| Score         | Description |
| :-------------: | :------------- |
| 0 | No network / local community. |
| 1 | Investigate existing local communities and the ways in which they network.      |
| 2 | Find a few other practitioners who are interested in networking.      |
| 3 | Set up or join a digital space for communication (e.g., mailing list, confluence space).      |
| 4 | Organize or contribute to a meetup.     |
| 5 | Commit to connecting with the community on a recurring basis. |
