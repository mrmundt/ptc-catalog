# THG GitHub Migration

## Target

Transition from a collaborative Git workflow that supports only non-CI testing to one that supports low-cost CI testing and is transparent to community contributors.

## User Story

As a developer or reviewer, I want to be certain that all code changes pass all merge-request tests.

As a community contributor, I want my contributions to be held to the same standards as the HDF Group's internal development.
