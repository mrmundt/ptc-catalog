# Agile Adoption

## Target

Team begins with Kanban and adopts additional processes in response to specific team needs.

## User Story

As a project leader, I have heard of teams that have adopted Agile workflows and significant success, and others that have had a very negative experience. Therefore, I want to capture the advantages of Agile without wasting time on unnecessary overhead so that I can improve the productivity of my team.


## Card

| Score         | Description |
| :-------------: | :------------- |
| 0 | Kanban board exists for team. |
| 1 | Kanban and Personal Kanban concepts introduced to team.      |
| 2 | Team consistently uses Kanban board for tracking work for at least two weeks.      |
| 3 | Team has held a retrospective to evaluate pros and cons of Kanban experience and has selected one to three experiments with other Agile processes to try for one month to address specific team needs.      |
| 4 | Team has evaluated experiments and decided which practices to continue at 2nd retrospective, as well as choosen 1-3 new experiments of any kind related to team needs.      |
| 5 | Team has held 3rd retrospective and decided which of 2nd group experiments to adopt permanently, as well as evaluated the Agile process improvement experience more generally.   |

## Comments

1. Examples of Agile processes include stand-up meetings, additional Kanban board columns, user stories, epic/story/task work breakdowns, etc.
