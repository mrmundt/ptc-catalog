# Creating Community Policies

## Target

Community software policies (and process for revisin over time)

## User Story

As a developer of a software library, I want to collaborate with others to establish software community policies for our topical area (e.g., numerical software, data/viz software, development tools, etc.) so that we can more effectively enable the combined use of diverse, independent packages and improve software quality.

## Card

| Score | Description |
|:-----:|:------------|
| 0 | No community policies |
| 1 | Outline of initial software community policies, including determining: community members to collaborate on initial draft policies and general goals of policies |
| 2 | Specific plan (made with collaborators) for adopting software community policies, including: refined goals of policies, approach for discussing/revising policies, approach for publishing policies and soliciting feedback from the broader community, plan/timeline for packages to implement software community policies |
| 3 | Published software community policies (initial draft)
| 4 | Feedback collected from broader community on software policies |
| 5 | Revised version of software community policies, addressing feedback |
| 6 | Packages that implement software community policies |


## Comments

- This card was inspired by the BSSw.io article [What are Interoperable Software Libraries? Introducing the xSDK](https://bssw.io/items/what-are-interoperable-software-libraries-introducing-the-xsdk)
- Once this card is completed, teams are encouraged to loop back to step 2 for further revisions; also possibly pursue a related topic: coordinated release of software packages that are compatible with community software policies |
